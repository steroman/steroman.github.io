							<li>Client: Agencia Tributaria (AEAT)</li>
							<li>Language locale: Spanish &#127466;&#127480;</li>
							<li>Project: Android app onboarding flow redesign</li>
							<li>Date: November 2020</li>

						<h3>Some context</h3>
						<p>When our teacher at the <a href="https://weareshifta.com/curso/ux-writing"
								alt="UX Writing course overview by SHIFTA">UX writing course by Shifta</a> asked which
							onboarding we wanted to redo and I told her it was the one from the AEAT android app, “you
							don’t know what you’re getting yourself into!”.<br />In fact, many of the changes proposed
							leaked into the space of user flow and UI design.</p>
						<p>Still, this was my fantasy world and, aside from unicorns, I could bend reality to my taste -
							no devs or PMs saying “we don’t have the resources or tech to do that!”.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<p>Overall, I felt that the onboarding flow did not anticipate any of my needs or doubts as a
							user. What can I do with this app? How do I use it? How will it make my life better? These
							are the questions that I tried to answer and that informed my content proposals.</p>
						<p>The strict relationship with the Cl@ve PIN system always got in the way. I decided to avoid
							mentioning it in the onboarding because at this point the user still has to engage with the
							app, so I thought it would be better not to overwhelm them. When they actually decide to
							sign up, the app would redirect them to Cl@ve PIN.</p>
						<p>It wasn’t easy to escape the tentacles of jargon and avoid falling into assumptions in
							regards of what domain-specific terms the users were familiar with - think about “Cartera de
							usuarios” in the 3rd screen.</p>
						<p>Being inclusive in Spanish is always challenging, but also very entertaining for language
							nerds like me. Especially for the excessive presence of masculine as the standard form in
							the language.</p>
						<h4>UX writing</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Formal language - notice the use of “Usted” when referring to the user - pointing to an
								overall distant tone
							<li>It wasn’t easy to escape the tentacles of jargon and avoid falling into assumptions in
								regards of what domain-specific terms the users were familiar with - think about
								“Cartera de usuarios” in the 3rd screen.</li>
							<li>Being inclusive in Spanish is always challenging, but also very entertaining for
								language nerds like me. Especially for the excessive presence of masculine as the
								standard form in the language.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Flow</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The onboarding was only used to show new features. New users were left out of the
								picture
							</li>
							<li>The new feature presented seemed to be targeting only accountants who managed multiple
								users. What about users who just managed their taxes?
							</li>
							<li>The strict relationship with the Cl@ve PIN system always got in the way. I decided to
								avoid mentioning it at this point. The user still has to engage with the app, better not
								to overwhelm them. When they actually decide to sign up, the app would redirect them to
								Cl@ve PIN. Same for the privacy policy as the first screen of the onboarding.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Design</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The visual hierarchy on the following screens was non-existent</li>
							<li>Buttons did not stand out as clickable entities. The only visual clue provided is the
								use of all-caps</li>
							<li>I found it hard to relate the hero images used to the feature they were meant to
								describe</li>
							<li>The presence of both carousel icons and previous/next buttons seemed a little redundant,
								however, keeping it felt emphatic</li>
							<li>The color palette felt a little off, especially the color of the carousel dots</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Usability</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>The button to Skip the onboarding was missing</li>
							<li>The button to access the Onboarding (or Quick Tour) again once inside the app was also
								missing. However, this was out of scope for this case study
							</li>
							<li>I found it hard to relate the hero images used to the feature they were meant to
								describe</li>
							<li>The presence of both carousel icons and previous/next buttons seemed a little redundant,
								however, keeping it felt emphatic</li>
							<li>The color palette felt a little off, especially the color of the carousel dots</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Problems Solved</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Get rid of the distant and cold tone</li>
							<li>Focus on the main benefits of the user</li>
							<li>Despite masculines slipped through in some occasions - was the only way to avoiding
								using always the same constructions - I was quite satisfied with the overall inclusivity
								reached by the copies from a gender-equality perspective</li>
							<li>Move what seems to be a edge case and a new feature to the last screen</li>
							<li>Moved the Cl@ve PIN reference out of the onboarding. At this point the user still has
								not engaged with the app and introducing a requirement that’s still not needed may be
								felt as overwhelming. Introduce the requirements only when they’re required.</li>
							<li>Tried to achieve a more homogeneous visual hierarchy and color palette</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Learnings</h3>
						Approach the storytelling from the same angle at every screen - either feature-based or
						benefit-based - makes the overall onboarding experience more cohesive by reducing cognitive load
						for the user.

							<p>Design and visual hierarchy obviously didn't help, but the content was not clear for the
								user. On top of that, it was hard to relate icons to what was written below.</p>

							<p>By contrast, fixing old usability issues and focusing the content on what the user can
